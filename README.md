# fireflies_sync_simulator

"Coupled oscillators and biological synchronization" SH Strogatz, I Stewart - Scientific American, 1993 - JSTOR implementation

Simulator able to run independent synchronization oscilators routines.
All the oscilators are independent and coupled all-to-all.
There is no centralized control, all the oscilators have the same dynamics.

You can set:

Nr. of oscilators(fireflies)
Cyclpe period
Time step
Time duration

You can:

Run simulation
See postprocessing plots
